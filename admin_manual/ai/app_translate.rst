==========================================
App: Local Machine translation (translate)
==========================================

.. _ai-app-translate:

The *translate* app is one of the apps that provide machine translation functionality in Nextcloud and act as a translation backend for the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>`, the *text* app and :ref:`other apps making use of the core Translation API<mt-consumer-apps>`. The *translate* app specifically runs only open source models and does so entirely on-premises. Nextcloud customers receive customer support upon request.

The app currently supports the following languages:

* English (en)
* German (de)
* French (fr)
* Spanish (es)
* Chinese (zh)

As the models are entirely open source, the quality of translations may not be comparable to commercially available machine translation services.

Requirements
------------

* x86 CPU
* GNU lib C (musl is not supported)
* This app does not support using GPU for processing and may thus not be performing ideally for long texts

(*Note*: Nextcloud AIO is currently not supported due to it using musl)

Space usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

 * ~1GB per language pair
 * ~10GB in total

Installation
------------

You can install the assistant app via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud, or by executing
